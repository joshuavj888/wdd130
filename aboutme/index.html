    <h2>Joshua Johnson</h2>
    <h2>please call me JJ.</h2>
    <p>I live in Farmington, UT. I work in credit repair helping people improve their credit. I have been doing that two years. I like horror movies, tv shows and books. I occasionally like playing video games, but I don't enjoy that as much as I did previously. I am wanting to become a computer programmer on my next step toward improving myself. I am currently working toward a Bachelors Degree. </p>
    <p>I have been a memeber of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. I have ancestors that were around at the time the church was founded and knew Joseph Smith Jr. personally. One of my ancestors is mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants 124. His name is Aaron Johnson.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning with all of you and getting to know you all better.</p>
