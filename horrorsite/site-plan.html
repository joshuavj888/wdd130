      <h3>Movies Page</h3>
      <p>Smile is one of the horror movies I have seen this year. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this movie at first. But after I saw it, I was glad I did. It had some interesting story elements that made it an interesting movie. Yes, some of the story elements have been done before. However, it is okay to re-visit similar ideas and see them reimagined by someone else when it is a complete fresh story, as opposed to a remake. I can also be fun to imagine different endings than the original. Would you have the ending happen the same way? Is there a way the main character could have done things differently? These are fun things to think about. The movie does have a lot of blood and gore in it and is rated R. So please keep that in mind if you don't like that in the movies you watch. You can read more about the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15474916/">here</a>.</p>
	    <p>Barbarian was another movie I saw recently. It has some really creepy parts and I found some of the story interesting. Other parts were not as interesting. There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie as well and it is also rated R. The story is really odd and doesn't flow very well in parts. You really have to stretch your imagination to make this one seam real. It also appears to want you sympathize with the antagonist, which didn't happen in my case. Far from one of the best movies I have seen, but it is still enjoyable in parts. Other parts are just plane boring. You can read more about this movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15791034/?ref_=ttls_li_tt">here</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>TV Shows Page</h3>
      <p>Stranger Things is a tv series I really like. It is now in season four and has some really fun moments. This series can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults. It does have some violence, so it isn’t for young children. I do enjoy the story line. It has parts with a lot of actions, and other parts that are light hearted and funny, and parts that are very serious. Each season builds on the last one and adds its own elements to the story. You do have to subscribe to Netflix to watch this one. But it is worth it, even if you cancel your subscription after you have watched the series. More information on the latest season of Stranger Things <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">here</a>.</p>
      <p>NOS4A2 is another tv series that I like. It is about a man that uses supernatural powers to kidnap children and take them to a place he created in the world of thought called “Christmasland”. The antagonist is able to use the children to keep himself alive and immortal. Since they children are also locked in a state of eternal childhood, some of the aspects of the series remind me of Peter Pan. But if the children were antagonists, not protagonists as the children kill and drink blood. Not really a series for children, maybe teens. Adults are okay to watch it. Find out more about the series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5194792/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">here</a>.</p>
