      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to create a website to provide information on horror movies. The idea will be to attract horror fans. Both long time fans of the genre and new fans. I would also like it to be a place that even non fans that are curious about the genre can come to find out more information. I would like the home page to provide some basic information about the website and its purpose. I would like a list on the website of different kinds of horror movies. Such as ghost stories, monsters, thrillers, suspense, etc. I would like each one to be a link that moves to another website that explains a little bit about that section of the content and will provide examples of movies/tv shows that fit that category. More on that later. I would like a banner image related to the horror genre on the homepage. I want a header that will include the logo and the navigation bar. I also would like a footer that will include links to social media and some information about me, the site creator. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Information Page</h3>
      <p>
        Information page
	      Which leads me to my next page. It will be similar to an FAQ, but will have different areas for the different kinds of horror movies and tv shows that I listed in the last paragraph. The links will take the guest to a different section of this site based on what they wanted to read about. Whether it would be horror about ghosts, or monsters. It would describe a little bit about each kind of horror show and give some examples of movies/shows that would fall in that category. I am also considering expanding this section to include information on different horror books as well. That will depend on how much time I have to spend on it of course. But I can definitely see having book information available on the site as well. I would like to include a picture for each entry, if possible, as well. Just a small image, logo size, maybe a movie poster, or a picture of the front of the book. It could add a good visual to each entry. But again, this might be too much content for this project. We will see if I can include that or not as I develop the site. I likely have way more ideas than I will be able to implement in the time I have to work on the project.

      </ul>
      <h3>Message Board/Blog</h3>
      <p>
        The third section of the website I would like to create is a message board that the different guests to the website would be able to come to post questions and thoughts for each other to read, and even respond too. This idea makes me nervous because I do not know much about making this kind of page. I might just end up having a blog instead if I have problems making the message board and getting it to work right. Especially since I would need to create a database of users so people could log in. That is probably outside the scope of this class. If I do go the blog route. I will probably right my opinions on different horror movies I have seen. For each movie, there will probably be two sections. One that does not include spoilers and one that does. So that that guest that doesn’t want spoilers can skip that section, but the guests that don’t mind the spoilers can read the information I have posted about the plot. This could be a really fun thing to write. I might also get some other people to right some blog entries and well and post them to the site.
