        <p>Smile is one of the horror movies I have seen this year. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this movie at first. But after I saw it, I was glad I did. It had some interesting story elements that made it an interesting movie. Yes, some of the story elements have been done before. However, it is okay to re-visit similar ideas and see them reimagined by someone else when it is a complete fresh story, as opposed to a remake. I can also be fun to imagine different endings than the original. Would you have the ending happen the same way? Is there a way the main character could have done things differently? These are fun things to think about. The movie does have a lot of blood and gore in it and is rated R. So please keep that in mind if you don't like that in the movies you watch.

        <p>Barbarian was another movie I saw recently. It has some really creepy parts and I found some of the story interesting. Other parts were not as interesting. There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie as well and it is also rated R. The story is really odd and doesn't flow very well in parts. You really have to stretch your imagination to make this one seam real. It also appears to want you sympathize with the antagonist, which didn't happen in my case. Far from one of the best movies I have seen, but it is still enjoyable in parts. Other parts are just plane boring.
