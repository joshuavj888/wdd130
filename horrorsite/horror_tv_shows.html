        <p>Stranger Things is a tv series I really like. It is now in season four and has some really fun moments. This series can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults. It does have some violence, so it isn’t for young children. I do enjoy the story line. It has parts with a lot of actions, and other parts that are light hearted and funny, and parts that are very serious. Each season builds on the last one and adds its own elements to the story. You do have to subscribe to Netflix to watch this one. But it is worth it, even if you cancel your subscription after you have watched the series. More information on the latest season of Stranger Things <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">here</a>.</p>

        <p>NOS4A2 is another tv series that I like. It is about a man that uses supernatural powers to kidnap children and take them to a place he created in the world of thought called “Christmasland”. The antagonist is able to use the children to keep himself alive and immortal. Since they children are also locked in a state of eternal childhood, some of the aspects of the series remind me of Peter Pan. But if the children were antagonists, not protagonists as the children kill and drink blood. Not really a series for children, maybe teens. Adults are okay to watch it.
